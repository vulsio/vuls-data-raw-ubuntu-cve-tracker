  "candidate": "CVE-2008-4107",
  "description": "The (1) rand and (2) mt_rand functions in PHP 5.2.6 do not produce cryptographically strong random numbers, which allows attackers to leverage exposures in products that rely on these functions for security-relevant functionality, as demonstrated by the password-reset functionality in Joomla! 1.5.x and WordPress before 2.6.2, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108, and CVE-2008-4102.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "as of 2009-04-10, unfixed in debian with following comment: the rand() and mt_rand() functions were never said to be cryptographically strong AFAICT, unfixed upstream also more information here: http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/17/mt_srand-and-not-so-random-numbers/ Let's ignore this also."
