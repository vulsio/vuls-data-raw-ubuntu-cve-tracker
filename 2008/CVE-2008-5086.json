{
	"candidate": "CVE-2008-5086",
	"description": "Multiple methods in libvirt 0.3.2 through 0.5.1 do not check if a connection is read-only, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and perform administrative actions.",
	"ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that libvirt did not mark certain operations as read-only. A local attacker may be able to perform privileged actions such as migrating virtual machines, adjusting autostart flags, or accessing privileged data in the virtual machine memory and disks.",
	"notes": {
		"jdstrand": "should also be fixed in 0.5.1-4 in Debian experimental"
