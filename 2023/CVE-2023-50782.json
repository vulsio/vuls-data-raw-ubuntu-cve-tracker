	"candidate": "CVE-2023-50782",
	"description": "A flaw was found in the python-cryptography package. This issue may allow a remote attacker to decrypt captured messages in TLS servers that use RSA key exchanges, which may lead to exposure of confidential or sensitive data.",
	"notes": {
		"litios": "The issue is in OpenSSL, fixed in 3.2.0. Once OpenSSL fix is backported, a no-change rebuild of cryptography would be needed to fix the vulnerability.",
		"mdeslaur": "as of 2024-02-19, there doesn't appear to be an upstream fix for this issue"
