  "candidate": "CVE-2023-23931",
  "description": "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.",
  "notes": {
    "ccdm94": "as per the advisory, this vulnerability was introduced in version 1.8.",
    "mdeslaur": "Per the upstream advisory: \"This is a soundness bug -- it allows programmers to misuse an API, it cannot be exploited by attacker controlled data alone.\"",
