{
	"candidate": "CVE-2023-4235",
	"description": "A flaw was found in ofono, an Open Source Telephony on Linux. A stack overflow bug is triggered within the decode_deliver_report() function during the SMS decoding. It is assumed that the attack scenario is accessible from a compromised modem, a malicious base station, or just SMS. There is a bound check for this memcpy length in decode_submit(), but it was forgotten in decode_deliver_report().",
	"notes": {
		"sbeattie": "Fedora seems to think that this was fixed in ofono 2.5; however, while that release does seem to add some additional bounds checks, the specific function referenced has not been touched since 2010. It's not clear if or how this was fixed upstream."
