	"candidate": "CVE-2021-45081",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Cobbler through 3.3.1. Routines in several files use the HTTP protocol instead of the more secure HTTPS.",
	"notes": {
		"nickgalanis": "Using HTTPS everywhere requires a deep knowledge of how customers implements cobbler in their network and how do they manage certificates. The maintainer decided to not patch this vulnerability, and will keep attention on this in order to create a certificate enrolling and trusting layer in the python code for the future. Thus, this CVE is marked as ignored."
