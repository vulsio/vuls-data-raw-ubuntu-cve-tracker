	"description": "ELinks before 0.11.3, when sending a POST request for an https URL, appends the body and content headers of the POST request to the CONNECT request in cleartext, which allows remote attackers to sniff sensitive data that would have been protected by TLS.  NOTE: this issue only occurs when a proxy is defined for https.",
	"ubuntu_description": "Kalle Olavi Niemitalo discovered that if elinks makes a POST request to an HTTPS URL through a proxy, information may be sent in clear-text between elinks and the proxy. Attackers with access to the network could steal sensitive information (such as passwords).",
