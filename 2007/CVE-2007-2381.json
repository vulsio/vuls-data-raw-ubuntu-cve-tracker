	"candidate": "CVE-2007-2381",
	"description": "The MochiKit framework exchanges data using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) without an associated protection scheme, which allows remote attackers to obtain the data via a web page that retrieves the data through a URL in the SRC attribute of a SCRIPT element and captures the data using other JavaScript code, aka \"JavaScript Hijacking.\"",
	"notes": {
		"jdstrand": "This CVE is general class of attacks called Javascript Hijacking. It's impact is largely dependent on how the developer a) uses the library, b) configures the library and c) interacts with the server. While the paper recommends defeating hijacking via both of two means, the CVE states that Mochikit does not have \"an associated protection scheme\". Mochikit can be configured to use POST instead of GET, and with server side scripting (as proposed in the paper), can thwart the attack."
