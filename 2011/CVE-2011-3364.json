	"candidate": "CVE-2011-3364",
	"description": "Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in the svEscape function in settings/plugins/ifcfg-rh/shvar.c in the ifcfg-rh plug-in for GNOME NetworkManager 0.9.1, 0.9.0, 0.8.1, and possibly other versions, when PolicyKit is configured to allow users to create new connections, allows local users to execute arbitrary commands via a newline character in the name for a new network connection, which is not properly handled when writing to the ifcfg file.",
	"notes": {
		"mdeslaur": "This is for the redhat-specific plugin, but we need to check if the debian plugin has the same flaw, as it may be based on the same code We don't look vulnerable to this, and embedded newline chars seem to be handled correctly."
