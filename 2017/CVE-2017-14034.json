  "description": "The restore_tqb_pixels function in hevc_filter.c in libavcodec, as used in libbpg 0.9.7 and other products, miscalculates a memcpy destination address, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.",

    "ebarretto": "This is a libbpg issue and not ffmpeg. So moving to not for us since we don't ship libbpg."
