	"candidate": "CVE-2014-7169",
	"description": "GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to write to files or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.",
	"notes": {
		"mdeslaur": "It was discovered that a build issue preventing the fix from being applied properly in the 4.3-7ubuntu1.2 package for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. A respin was released to 4.3-7ubuntu1.3 to correct the issue, and USN-2363-2 was published."
