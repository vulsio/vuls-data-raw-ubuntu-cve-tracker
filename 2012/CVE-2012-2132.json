  "candidate": "CVE-2012-2132",
  "description": "libsoup 2.32.2 and earlier does not validate certificates or clear the trust flag when the ssl-ca-file does not exist, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by connecting with a SSL connection.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "This isn't actually a flaw in libsoup, it's a flaw in applications that don't set ssl-strict, and don't set ssl-ca-file, but expect SOUP_MESSAGE_CERTIFICATE_TRUSTED to mean something. Applications should either set a ssl-ca-file, or ignore SOUP_MESSAGE_CERTIFICATE_TRUSTED. We aren't going to fix this in libsoup. Applications should be fixed instead. Marked as ignored."
