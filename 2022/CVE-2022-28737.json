	"candidate": "CVE-2022-28737",
	"description": "There's a possible overflow in handle_image() when shim tries to load and execute crafted EFI executables; The handle_image() function takes into account the SizeOfRawData field from each section to be loaded. An attacker can leverage this to perform out-of-bound writes into memory. Arbitrary code execution is not discarded in such scenario.",

		"eslerm": "keys not updated on ESM releases as doing so would revoke install media keys",
