{
	"candidate": "CVE-2022-28321",
	"description": "The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows authentication bypass for SSH logins. The pam_access.so module doesn't correctly restrict login if a user tries to connect from an IP address that is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a user with denied access to a machine can still get access. NOTE: the relevance of this issue is largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory; it does not affect Linux-PAM upstream.",
	"notes": {
		"mdeslaur": "This CVE was assigned to a flaw in SUSE-specific code that was part of the upstream PR226, and did not make its way into the the upstream Linux-PAM code. The issue was fixed in PR447, which was included in upstream Linux-PAM 1.5.3. USN-5825-1 and USN-5825-2 added the whole PR447 which fixed a bug, even though the original package didn't contain the vulnerability described in this CVE. Marking lunar, mantic, and noble as not-affected since they do not contain the vulnerable code.",
		"rodrigo-zaiden": "it was stated that upstream is not affected, so, Ubuntu might not be affected as well, it worth checking"
