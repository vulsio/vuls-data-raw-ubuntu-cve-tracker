	"candidate": "CVE-2022-35583",
	"description": "wkhtmlTOpdf 0.12.6 is vulnerable to SSRF which allows an attacker to get initial access into the target's system by injecting iframe tag with initial asset IP address on it's source. This allows the attacker to takeover the whole infrastructure by accessing their internal assets.",
	"notes": {
		"ccdm94": "as of 2023-07-18, no fix for this vulnerability was made available by upstream. That is because this is not being considered a wkhtmltopdf issue, but instead an issue with applications using wktohtmlpdf without first sanitizing input that is user-supplied HTML/JS. In the related GitHub issue page it is possible to see that this issue is possibly being disputed. Commit 5426e55 was presented by maintainers as the commit that highlights the fact that they are aware of this behavior, and consider it to be expected."
