	"description": "There is a denial of service vulnerability in the Content-Disposition parsingcomponent of Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1, 3.0.0.1. This could allow an attacker to craft an input that can cause Content-Disposition header parsing in Rackto take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial ofservice attack vector. This header is used typically used in multipartparsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtuallyall Rails applications) are impacted.",
