  "description": "The default configuration for puppet masters 0.25.0 and later in Puppet before 2.6.18, 2.7.x before 2.7.21, and 3.1.x before 3.1.1, and Puppet Enterprise before 1.2.7 and 2.7.x before 2.7.2, allows remote authenticated nodes to submit reports for other nodes via unspecified vectors.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Upstream no longer supports 0.25.x as found in lucid. The code is substantially different, rendering a backport of this security update difficult. Since puppet in Lucid is almost end-of-life, we aren't planning on backporting the security fix to it. For Lucid users, we recommend using puppet 2.7.1-1ubuntu3.8~ubuntu10.04.1 currently in lucid-backports."
