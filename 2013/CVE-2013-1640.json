	"notes": {
		"mdeslaur": "Upstream no longer supports 0.25.x as found in lucid. The code is substantially different, rendering a backport of this security update difficult. Since puppet in Lucid is almost end-of-life, we aren't planning on backporting the security fix to it. For Lucid users, we recommend using puppet 2.7.1-1ubuntu3.8~ubuntu10.04.1 currently in lucid-backports."
