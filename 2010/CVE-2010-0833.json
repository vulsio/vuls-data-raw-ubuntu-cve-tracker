	"description": "The pam_lsass library in Likewise Open 5.4 and CIFS 5.4 before build 8046, and 6.0 before build 8234, as used in HP StorageWorks X9000 Network Storage Systems and possibly other products, uses \"SetPassword logic\" when running as part of a root service, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication for a Likewise Security Authority (lsassd) account whose password is marked as expired.",
	"ubuntu_description": "Matt Weatherford discovered that Likewise Open did not correctly check password expiration for the local-provider account. A local attacker could exploit this to log into a system they would otherwise not have access to.",
