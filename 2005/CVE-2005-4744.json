  "candidate": "CVE-2005-4744",
  "description": "Off-by-one error in the sql_error function in sql_unixodbc.c in FreeRADIUS 1.0.2.5-5, and possibly other versions including 1.0.4, might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by causing the external database query to fail. NOTE: this single issue is part of a larger-scale disclosure, originally by SUSE, which reported multiple issues that were disputed by FreeRADIUS. Disputed issues included file descriptor leaks, memory disclosure, LDAP injection, and other issues. Without additional information, the most recent FreeRADIUS report is being regarded as the authoritative source for this CVE identifier.",
