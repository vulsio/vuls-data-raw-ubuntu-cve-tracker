	"candidate": "CVE-2024-37408",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** fprintd through 1.94.3 lacks a security attention mechanism, and thus unexpected actions might be authorized by \"auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so\" for Sudo. NOTE: the supplier disputes this because they believe issue resolution would involve modifying the PAM configuration to restrict pam_fprintd.so to front-ends that implement a proper attention mechanism, not modifying pam_fprintd.so or fprintd.",
	"notes": {
		"mdeslaur": "This isn't really a vulnerability in fprintd, it's a limitation when command-line applications use pam for authentication. See mailing list discussion, this CVE was disputed. Marking as not-affected."
