	"candidate": "CVE-2024-35195",
	"description": "Requests is a HTTP library. Prior to 2.32.0, when making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same host will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.32.0.",
	"notes": {
		"mdeslaur": "On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles requests binaries when built. After updating requests, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required. On jammy and later, requests is bundled in the python-pip package and needs to be patched.  The fix for this issue introduced regressions in certain other applications, such as docker. See https://github.com/docker/docker-py/pull/3257 and resulted in 2.32.0 and 2.32.1 in being yanked, see: https://pypi.org/project/requests/#history  Marking as deferred until a better strategy to addres this issue can be determined."
