{
	"candidate": "CVE-2024-3094",
	"description": "Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with version 5.6.0. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.",
	"notes": {
		"mdeslaur": "The affected version of xz-utils was only in noble-proposed, and was removed before migrating to noble itself. No released versions of Ubuntu were affected by this issue."
