	"candidate": "CVE-2024-33901",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** Issue in KeePassXC 2.7.7 allows an attacker (who has the privileges of the victim) to recover some passwords stored in the .kdbx database via a memory dump. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because memory-management constraints make this unavoidable in the current design and other realistic designs.",
	"notes": {
		"alexmurray": "This vulnerability requires the attacker to dump the memory of the keepassxc process - in Ubuntu the default ptrace restrictions ensure that in general this cannot be done by other processes even belonging to the same user which lowers the severity of this vulnerability"
