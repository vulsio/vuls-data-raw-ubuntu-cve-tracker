	"candidate": "CVE-2018-5738",
	"description": "Change #4777 (introduced in October 2017) introduced an unforeseen issue in releases which were issued after that date, affecting which clients are permitted to make recursive queries to a BIND nameserver. The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the \"allow-recursion\" setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if \"recursion no;\" is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" settings IF \"recursion yes;\" (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of \"allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};\" if \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no values are explicitly set for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\". However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no match list values are provided for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" for the setting of \"allow-recursion\" to inherit a setting of all hosts from the \"allow-query\" setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients. Affects BIND 9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0->9.12.1-P2, the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1, and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.",
